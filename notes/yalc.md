[Yalc repo](https://github.com/whitecolor/yalc)

Say we have two repos:

`repo-a` which depends on npm `package-a`

### Step 1

Run `yalc publish` in the `package-a` repo

### Step 2

Run `yalc add package-a` in the `repo-a` repo

### Step 3

Run `yarn` in `repo-a`

###Â Step 4

Whenever you update `package-a`, run `yalc push` in the `package-a`, and run `yalc add package-a` in the `repo-a` repo

You may need to run `yarn build && yalc push` if `package-a` needs building first.

### Revert

When you're done testing with Yalc, run `yalc remove --all` to remove all the yalced packages from `repo-a`
